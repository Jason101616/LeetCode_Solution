# Design a Tic-tac-toe game that is played between two players on a n x n grid.

# You may assume the following rules:

# A move is guaranteed to be valid and is placed on an empty block.
# Once a winning condition is reached, no more moves is allowed.
# A player who succeeds in placing n of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.
# Example:
# Given n = 3, assume that player 1 is "X" and player 2 is "O" in the board.

# TicTacToe toe = new TicTacToe(3);

# toe.move(0, 0, 1); -> Returns 0 (no one wins)
# |X| | |
# | | | |    // Player 1 makes a move at (0, 0).
# | | | |

# toe.move(0, 2, 2); -> Returns 0 (no one wins)
# |X| |O|
# | | | |    // Player 2 makes a move at (0, 2).
# | | | |

# toe.move(2, 2, 1); -> Returns 0 (no one wins)
# |X| |O|
# | | | |    // Player 1 makes a move at (2, 2).
# | | |X|

# toe.move(1, 1, 2); -> Returns 0 (no one wins)
# |X| |O|
# | |O| |    // Player 2 makes a move at (1, 1).
# | | |X|

# toe.move(2, 0, 1); -> Returns 0 (no one wins)
# |X| |O|
# | |O| |    // Player 1 makes a move at (2, 0).
# |X| |X|

# toe.move(1, 0, 2); -> Returns 0 (no one wins)
# |X| |O|
# |O|O| |    // Player 2 makes a move at (1, 0).
# |X| |X|

# toe.move(2, 1, 1); -> Returns 1 (player 1 wins)
# |X| |O|
# |O|O| |    // Player 1 makes a move at (2, 1).
# |X|X|X|
# Follow up:
# Could you do better than O(n^2) per move() operation?

# idea: The key observation is that in order to win Tic-Tac-Toe you must have the entire row or column. Thus, we don't need to keep track of an entire n^2 board. We only need to keep a count for each row and column. If at any time a row or column matches the size of the board then that player has won.
# time: O(1), space: O(n)

# There are a row of n houses, each house can be painted with one of the three colors: red, blue or green. The cost of painting each house with a certain color is different. You have to paint all the houses such that no two adjacent houses have the same color.

# The cost of painting each house with a certain color is represented by a n x 3 cost matrix. For example, costs[0][0] is the cost of painting house 0 with color red; costs[1][2] is the cost of painting house 1 with color green, and so on... Find the minimum cost to paint all houses.

# Note:
# All costs are positive integers.


# idea: 直到房子i，其最小的涂色开销是直到房子i-1的最小涂色开销，加上房子i本身的涂色开销。但是房子i的涂色方式需要根据房子i-1的涂色方式来确定，所以我们对房子i-1要记录涂三种颜色分别不同的开销，这样房子i在涂色的时候，我们就知道三种颜色各自的最小开销是多少了。我们在原数组上修改，可以做到不用空间。

# Given a singly linked list, return a random node's value from the linked list. Each node must have the same probability of being chosen.

# Follow up:
# What if the linked list is extremely large and its length is unknown to you? Could you solve this efficiently without using extra space?

# Example:

# // Init a singly linked list [1,2,3].
# ListNode head = new ListNode(1);
# head.next = new ListNode(2);
# head.next.next = new ListNode(3);
# Solution solution = new Solution(head);

# // getRandom() should return either 1, 2, or 3 randomly. Each element should have equal probability of returning.
# solution.getRandom();

# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode(object):
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

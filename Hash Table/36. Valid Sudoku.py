# Determine if a 9x9 Sudoku board is valid. Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the following rules:
#
# Each row must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
# Each column must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
# Each of the 9 3x3 sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
#
# A partially filled sudoku which is valid.
#
# The Sudoku board could be partially filled, where empty cells are filled with the character '.'.
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input:
# [
#   ["5","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."],
#   ["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."],
#   [".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."],
#   ["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"],
#   ["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"],
#   ["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"],
#   [".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."],
#   [".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"],
#   [".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]
# ]
# Output: true
# Example 2:
#
# Input:
# [
#   ["8","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."],
#   ["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."],
#   [".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."],
#   ["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"],
#   ["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"],
#   ["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"],
#   [".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."],
#   [".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"],
#   [".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]
# ]
# Output: false
# Explanation: Same as Example 1, except with the 5 in the top left corner being
#     modified to 8. Since there are two 8's in the top left 3x3 sub-box, it is invalid.
# Note:
#
# A Sudoku board (partially filled) could be valid but is not necessarily solvable.
# Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the mentioned rules.
# The given board contain only digits 1-9 and the character '.'.
# The given board size is always 9x9.
